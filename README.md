### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

1. Does the site work as-is, or did you need to tweak it to work?

The site seems to function just fine, displaying all the data it needed to. Although the website was fairly simple, it didn't look unprofessional or sloppy. 

2. Try improving the result, and updating the files based on the results. Did that help?

I unfortunately was unable to tweak the results, as Claude "ran into unexpected capacity restraints" (I needed to upgrade to pro). The new and improved Ravie-font version of the website is trapped in limbo forever. I will say that it did seem capable of doing so; it was working through the process when the error message hit. It just needed more money. 

3. Think of a journalism circumstance where you might use this sort of technique that doesn't involve elections. Describe how you would do it.

I can see a site like this being helpful in publishing a major project. For example, a website could help readers navigate a complicated topic with many factors, like the current Howard Center hazardous derailments project. Keeping things like that organized in the form of a website could be a useful medium for publishing reports with a lot of statistics and data. To accomplish this, I would probably need a very detailed prompt assigning data to specific webpages. A single-pager could possibly work, if we were making use of those drop-down menus, but it would be a very long page.
